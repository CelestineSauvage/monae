* Monadic equational reasoning in Coq

This repository contains a formalization of monads including several
models, examples of monadic equational reasoning, and an application
to program semantics.

** Requirements

- [[https://coq.inria.fr][Coq 8.9.0]]
  + should be fine with slightly older versions
- [[https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/][MathComp 1.7]]
- [[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][mathcomp-analysis]]
  + used in particular for ~classical_sets.v~ (in [[monad_model.v][monad_model.v]] and [[altprob_model.v][altprob_model.v]] for example)
- [[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][infotheo]]
  + used in particular for probabilities

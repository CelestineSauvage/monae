One way to install monae on Windows 10 is to
1. use the Windows binary distribution of Coq
2. use cygwin to recreate a Unix-like environment

* Step 1: Install cygwin

- Download and execute ~setup-x86_64.exe~ from [[https://www.cygwin.com/][https://www.cygwin.com/]]
  + Choose ~emacs~, ~emacs-X11~, ~xinit~, ~make~, ~texlive~ to have a
    minimal working environment
- Double-click the "Cygwin64 Terminal" on the Desktop
- In the terminal, execute ~startxwin~ to start X11
  + An Cygwin-X11 icon (a black "C" with a green "X" inside) appears
    among the System Tray icons
  + Right-clicking this icon gives access to XTerm, Emacs, etc.
- Add a few more useful programs by re-running the cygwin installer
  + these programs would be useful in particular for ~opam~ that
    unfortunately does not work correctly with Windows 10 as of today
    + ~rsync~, ~patch~, ~make~, ~diffutils~, ~curl~, ~unzip~, ~git~,
      ~m4~, ~perl~, ~mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core~

** Trouble shooting

- Cygwin may be confused by a non-American keyboard; you can change
  the keyboard layout with ~setxkbmap~, e.g., for a Japanese keyboard,
  the following command ~setxkbmap -model jp106 -layout jp~
- You may want to get rid of the CAPS LOCK key by creatinge a file,
  say, ~Xmodmap~ with the following contents:
#+BEGIN_SRC
keycode 66 = Control_L
clear Lock
add Control = Control_L
#+END_SRC
  Append the following to ~.bashrc~:
#+BEGIN_SRC
xmodmap /home/username/Xmodmap
#+END_SRC

* Step 2: Install Coq

- Download and execute ~coq-8.9.1-installer-windows-x86_64.exe~ from
  the [[https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/latest][release page]]
- Add ~/cygdrive/c/coq/bin~ to ~PATH~ by appending ~export
  PATH=${PATH}~ to ~.bashrc~

* Step 3: Install Proof General

- Install proof general following the instructions [[https://proofgeneral.github.io/][online]]

* Step 4: Install the Required Libraries

- The MathComp library that comes with the Coq binaries is maybe not
  up-to-date
  + ~rm /cygdrive/c/coq/lib/user_contrib/mathcomp~
  + install MathComp 1.9.0
    * download the [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/releases][source files]]
    * unzip, untar, make, make install
- Install MathComp-Analysis
  + Install bigenough 1.0.0 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/bigenough][download]])
  + Install finmap 1.2.1 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/finmap][download]])
  + Install analysis 0.2.2 ([[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][download]])
- Install Infotheo ([[https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo][download]])
- Install monae
  + ~git clone git@github.com:affeldt-aist/monae.git~
  + ~coq_makefile -o Makefile -f _CoqProject~

* Addendum
** Install OCaml

- Re-run the cygwin installer to install ~opam~ (version 2 or higher)
- ~opam init~ (Answer "y" to questions)
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- Check that OCaml has been properly installed
  + ~ocaml --version~
  + (version at the time of this writing [2019-07-08 Mon]: 4.04.2)
- ~opam switch create 4.07.1~
- ~eval $(opam env)~
- ~opam install camlp5~ (version 7.06.10 [2019-07-08 Mon])
- ~opam install ocamlfind~ (version 1.8.0 [2019-07-08 Mon])
- ~opam install num.1.2~

** FAILURE Installing lablgtk

- ~opam install lablgtk~ fails with the following error despite having
  ~libgtk2.0-devel~ and ~mingw64-x86_64-gtk2.0~ installed with cygwin
#+BEGIN_SRC
This package requires gtk+ 2.0 development packages installed on your system
#+END_SRC

** FAILURE Installing Coq

**** Using Opam

- ~opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released~
- ~opam install coq.8.0.1~ fails because of the Coq's ~configure~

**** From the source

- Download ~coq.8.9.1.tar.gz~
- unzip and untar
- fail with an "address space is already occupied error" for ~dllunix.so~
